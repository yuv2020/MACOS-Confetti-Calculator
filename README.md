# macOS Scientific Calculator Clone

## Overview
Welcome to the macOS Scientific Calculator Clone! This project is a web-based replica of the macOS Scientific Calculator, built using React. The goal of this assignment is to showcase proficiency in front-end development, state management, and the ability to replicate sophisticated UI and UX.

## Features
### The calculator includes:

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\
Advanced Functions: Trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms (natural and base 10), exponents.\
Special Functions: Factorial, random number generation.\
Scientific Functions: Square root, power, and more.\

### Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\
JavaScript (ES6): Modern JavaScript features and syntax.\
CSS: Styling and layout.\
HTML: Markup structure.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
   cd calculator-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the calculator.

## Usage

- Click on the buttons to input numbers and perform operations.
- Use the special function buttons (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.) for advanced calculations.
- Press `C` to clear the current input or `AC` to clear all.

# Explanation of Each Button:

### Basic Buttons

● 0-9: Digits 0 through 9.\
● +/-: Changes the sign of the current number.\
● %: Calculates the percentage of the current number.\
● ÷: Division.\
● ×: Multiplication.\
● −: Subtraction.\
● +: Addition.\
● =: Calculates the result of the current operation.\
● AC: Clears all input (resets the calculator).

### Memory Buttons

● MC: Clears the memory.\
● M+: Adds the current value to the memory.\
● M-: Subtracts the current value from the memory.\
● MR: Recalls the value stored in memory.

### Scientific Buttons

● ( and ): Parentheses for grouping expressions.\
● 2nd: Toggles between primary and secondary functions on the calculator.\
● x2: Squares the current number.\
● x3: Cubes the current number.\
● xy: Raises the current number to the power of y.\
● ex: Calculates e raised to the power of the current number.\
● 10x: Calculates 10 raised to the power of the current number.\
● 1/x: Calculates the reciprocal of the current number.\
● 2√x: Calculates the square root of the current number.\
● 3√x: Calculates the cube root of the current number.\
● y√x: Calculates the yth root of the current number.\

● ln: Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the current number.\
● log10: Calculates the logarithm (base 10) of the current number.\
● x!: Calculates the factorial of the current number.\
● sin: Calculates the sine of the current number (in radians or degrees).\
● cos: Calculates the cosine of the current number (in radians or degrees).\
● tan: Calculates the tangent of the current number (in radians or degrees).\
● e: Inserts the constant e.\
● EE: Enters a number in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e5).\
● Rad: Toggles between radians and degrees for trigonometric functions.\
● sinh: Calculates the hyperbolic sine of the current number.\
● cosh: Calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the current number.\
● tanh: Calculates the hyperbolic tangent of the current number.\
● π: Inserts the constant π.\
● Rand: Generates a random number between 0 and 1.
